<Problem>: the theoretical result graph(generated by D_aware_verify1206.m) haven't be verified by simulation result.

1. add _0119.m
2. add a doc file

[Notes] From the graph result (Success Probability v.s. lambda), we can see that the "non-power control result" is right, while the "power controled" one, which is denoted as blue one, is way lower than the theoretical result.

3. check th_toy.m. The average of power control shouldn't be a random variable.Even though using mean() to make it a const, it still exist randomness in this term.
4. update th_toy.m.
	Assuming the magnitude of interference is 1e-5.
	[Target]:checking if power control scheme do have gain.
		The success probability of pc is larger than the one of npc.
	<Problem>:By checking the path loss gain of power control and non-power 		  control, we can see that the probability of larger than 1 is 			  0.5, i.e. only half of the sample will be larger than npc. 
		  Then how to explain the success probability gain?
5. PC_OUTAGE_1218.m is the latest testing script.
6. update _0119.m. I just combine "PC_OUTAGE_1218.m" and "D_aware_verify1206.m".
	The result is not as the same as I expected. Success Probability with
	power control is still too small.
